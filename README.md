# Happy thoughts Project

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started by making the components I thought I needed for the project. Then using the useEffect hook I fetched the data from the API provided. Then it was a matter of building each component in turn to display, be able to like, and lastly post your own, thoughts.
If I had more time I would have liked to added the liked-post counter.
